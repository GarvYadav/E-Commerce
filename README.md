# E-Commerse<br>
<p>Engineered a fully functional, mobile-first e-commerce frontend application using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, adhering to modern web development standards. Architected dynamic product rendering logic via array-based data structures and template literals, and implemented category-based filtering using event delegation and string matching. Built a stateful shopping cart system with real-time price aggregation using higher-order functions like .map(), .reduce(), and .find(). Integrated Web Storage API (localStorage) for persistent cart state and session retention across reloads. Developed an authentication interface with DOM-based form validation and simulated login state using conditional rendering and local storage tokens. Leveraged Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout Module for responsive UI composition, ensuring adaptability across viewport breakpoints. Utilized modular JavaScript functions, event-driven architecture, and dynamic DOM manipulation (createElement, appendChild, classList) to render UI components and update state on interaction. Applied progressive enhancement principles to maintain core functionality across environments. This project exemplifies front-end application design without reliance on external libraries or frameworks, focusing on native browser APIs and clean code organization.</p>
